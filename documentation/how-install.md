> ## Installation instructions.

For start the modification, you need installed Forge, it is desirable that the version matches the supported versions. You can download Forge from the [link](https://files.minecraftforge.net/maven/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.14.4.html).
Move the downloaded mod to the `mods` folder (installation example below).

Also do not forget to install dependencies, only two types of dependencies
    - mandatory (game will not start without a mod)
    - recommended (without a mod, game can start, but I recommend using it)

Downloads: [Cooldown](https://github.com/ProjectEssentials/ProjectEssentials-Cooldown) · [Core](https://github.com/ProjectEssentials/ProjectEssentials-Core) · [Permissions](https://github.com/ProjectEssentials/ProjectEssentials-Permissions)

```

Now try to start the game, go to the `mods` tab, if this modification is displayed in the `mods` tab, then the mod has been successfully installed.
